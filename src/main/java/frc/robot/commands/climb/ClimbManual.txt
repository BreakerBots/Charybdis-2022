Sequences:
    automated action sequences in which the robot wil move between bars on its own. (NOTE: Requires user imput to continue after initial extension)
        HOW TO USE: create sequence by chaining together desired Actions in order (with stability checks regurly spaced throughout).
            1. HighbarClimbSequence: robot starts from mid bar then climbs up and trevrses to high bar.
Actions:
    commands that are linked together in a series to form a climb sequence:
        1. MoveClimb: Extends or retracts climber arms to a spesified length in ticks of winch motor.
        2. PivotClimb: Extends or retracts pistons for climber arms. Used when climber is grabing new bars.
        3. climbStablityCheck: Waits for IMU's returned rate of YPR change to be below 5 degrees per second for 3 seconds befor allowing sequence to progress.
SequenceManagement:
    commands called within a climb sequence that do not directly effect the climber and that insted have support roles (imput checks, state changers, etc).
        2. EndClimbSequence: basicly just sets "isClimbing" to false.
        3. WaitForDownButton: Waits for user imput to continue with sequence after initial climber extension.
Manual Control: 
    if desired, the driver may take control of climb form the robot, allowing them full control over the robots climb
        - Controls: 
            a. D-PAD left engages Manual arm movement control (must be renabled after arm piviot).
            c. Right Joystick Y-axis controls climber arm movment after manual control has been enabled
            b. Y button toggles climb arm piviot (when activated manual arm control will stop untill renabled)
        - How To:
            a. If automated sequence has NOT been activated yet, than manual control can be assumed just as any outher teleop action would.
            b. If automated HAS been activated, then the dirver will first need to cancle the sequence useing the menu button, after that, manual control can be assumed as normal.
        - WARNING: AUTOMATED SEQUENCE CAN NOT BE REACTIVAED AFTER A MANUAL CLIMB HAS BEGUN OR THE AUTOMATED SEQUENCE HAS BEEN INTERUPTED
