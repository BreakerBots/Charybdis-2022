Sequences:
    automated action sequences in which the robot wil move between bars on its own. (NOTE: Requires user imput to continue after initial extension)
        HOW TO USE: create sequecen by chaining togetehr desired action in order (with stability checks regurly spaced throughout).Then put this sequence into 
            the "RunClimbSequence" command group called in robot contaner. In addition to your action sequence, the "RunClimbSequence" group should also
            call the "SequenceWatchdog" command.
Actions:
    commands that are linked together in a series to form a climb sequence:
        1. MoveClimb: Extends or retracts climber arms to a spesified length in ticks of winch motor.
        2. PivotClimb: Extends or retracts pistons for climber arms. Used when climber is grabing new bars.
        3. climbStablityCheck: Waits for IMU's returned rate of YPR change to be below 5 degrees per second for 3 seconds befor allowing sequence to progress.
SequenceManagement:
    commands called within a climb sequence that do not directly effect the climber and that insted have support roles.
        1. ResetSequenceNums: sets the total number of actions in a climb sequence to 0 of 0 for progress counter.
        2. SetSequenceNums: sets the total number of actions in a climb sequence for progress counter.
        3. WaitForDownButton: Waits for user imput to continue with sequence after initial climber extension.
        4. SequenceWatchdog: allows for manual or automatic termination of an active climb sequence by pressing the menu button or by the sequence exceading
            45 seconds in length. The latter of which will trigure a "Timed Out" cancel statement.
