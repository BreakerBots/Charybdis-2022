Sequences:
    automated action sequences in which the robot wil move between bars on its own. (NOTE: Requires user imput to continue after initial extension)
        HOW TO USE: create sequence by chaining togeteher desired Actions in order (with stability checks regurly spaced throughout).
            1. HighbarClimbSequence: robot starts from mid bar then climbs up and trevrses to high bar.
Actions:
    commands that are linked together in a series to form a climb sequence:
        1. MoveClimb: Extends or retracts climber arms to a spesified length in ticks of winch motor.
        2. PivotClimb: Extends or retracts pistons for climber arms. Used when climber is grabing new bars.
        3. climbStablityCheck: Waits for IMU's returned rate of YPR change to be below 5 degrees per second for 3 seconds befor allowing sequence to progress.
SequenceManagement:
    commands called within a climb sequence that do not directly effect the climber and that insted have support roles (dashboard, failsafes, etc).
        1. StartClimbSequence: resets climb progress counter to 0 of 0, resets climb motor encoders, and sets "isClimbing" to true.
        2. EndClimbSequence: basicly just sets "isClimbing" to false.
        2. SetSequenceNums: sets the total number of actions in a climb sequence for progress counter.
        3. WaitForDownButton: Waits for user imput to continue with sequence after initial climber extension.
        4. SequenceWatchdog: allows ClimbWatchdog class to interact with (and cancle) active climb sequence.
